General
-------
* Use KeyboardFocusManager (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/focus.html) more intelligently
  instead of dispatching keys self. Change "focus traversal keys".

* Skins (or atleast centralized control over colors, sizes and images).

* Mouse cursor that diappears when it stands still for a few seconds

* IPod style menu for interface (with current plugin active in the background)
  Meaning something like this:
    |-Music
    |    |-Artists
    |    |-Albums
    |    |-Songs
    |
    |-Movies
    |    |-Bond
    |    |-New
    |    |-Barn
    |
    |-Games
         |-C64
         |-SNES

  The plugins actually add parts of a menu and when you start playing music or movie or a game,
  the menuitem (added by plugin) starts a player which stops the current player. So we have MenuItems and Players.

TV plugin
