General
-------

* Use KeyboardFocusManager (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/focus.html) more intelligently
  instead of dispatching keys self. Change "focus traversal keys". 

* Skins (or atleast centralized control over colors, sizes and images).
* Configuration
* Mouse cursor that diappears when it stands still for a few seconds


TV plugin
---------
* How to do anything? (linux dvb?)
* Program guides (xmltv?)


Music plugin
------------
* Playlists
* "Look aside" playlists (select a few songs in a queue to be played before the normal strategy takes back control)
* Exclude/ban track
* Album art viewer
* FF and REW
* Better fallback names (remove .mp3 and .flac and guess some nice case)
* Better Bitrate figures: show VBR rates correctly and show flac differently.
* Played songs can get lost (unstoppable if you press "next" too fast)


Game plugin
-----------


Video plugin
------------
* Support for multifile videos
* IMDB info retrieval
* Support for playing on-disk DVD's (with ogle?)
* Support for categorizing movies (differently from the on-disk tree).


Pictures plugin
---------------
